# password-generator-random

## Description

This project is my first real Javascript project.  It is a password generator that will generate a password based on the criteria that the user selects.  The criteria's available are password length, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols/special characters.   During this I learned a lot about functions and operating a for loop.
